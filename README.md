# Real-snow-review
modified the script to have all in an operator

* Modification of an integrated addon Real Snow
you can find it in the search bar key word "snow"
or in the menu add object as "Add Snow"

You need an active object and you can select several objects
At first apply to All selected is unchecked. so you can do some modifications in the redo menu (F9) on the active object (go to wireframe view if to heavy) and then apply to all
this is using a lot of particles and the creation of a material from script take a while in Blender...
I recommand to do it on 1 object do the settings and then do it on several objects. 2nd time will be quicker because of material already created.
If you want you can also select some faces then check selected faces...
Result is great


Maybe I will change the way again to apply mat and particles only after modifications of the shape...
